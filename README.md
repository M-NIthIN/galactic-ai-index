Galactic AI Index
A Custom Index Tracking of AI and Space Technology Sectors
===

Overview
The Galactic AI Index is a simulated, custom-built stock index tracking a basket of companies in the AI and space technology sectors. Designed to mirror real-world index production workflows, this project demonstrates index construction, financial data handling, and automated data pipelines, while integrating Python, pandas, Excel, and SFTP/cloud simulation.
